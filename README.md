# Converter Android Application

### Rationale for product and software

I decide to design a mobile application for Converter's client students for several reasons below: My general aim is to build an online learning communities for students with shared resource centers and discussion sections, which makes up for the lack of extracurricular extensions at school; the product therefore has to be capable of a variety of interactions, which means that applications would be more suitable than forms like websites;  also, regarding the fact that our target client group, students in public primary or middle schools in China, are usually not allowed to bring laptops but only mobile phones in school, mobile applications would be more convenient for them to access and use than web applications. 

I use Android Studio as the tool to code in Java and generate XML resource files as it is a mature technical platform with a relatively lower threshold for application developers: a clear user interface, built-in templates and emulators, and well-organized official tutorials on the website that provide me with significant convenience as a starter of application design; it also provides functionalities to connect to the internet and cloud database and; moreover, it enables packing up the application into bundles, which includes all features and resources of the application and is ready to be downloaded by the end users. For the data storage, I use Alibaba Cloud SQL Database that I’m familiar with, so there aren’t many technical difficulties; its storage and speeds are comparable to commercial cloud databases while remaining much cheaper; the built-in security is also guaranteed.
